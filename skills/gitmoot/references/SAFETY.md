# Gitmoot Safety Reference

## Repo Scope

A PR repository is the routing context for `/gitmoot <agent> ...`. Always confirm
or pass `--repo owner/repo` when the user works across multiple repositories.

## Branch Locks

Implementation jobs must respect Gitmoot branch locks. Do not edit or push an
implementation branch unless Gitmoot assigned the job and the branch lock is held
by the assigned agent.

Review and ask jobs should inspect and report without mutating branches unless
the task explicitly instructs otherwise.

Useful commands:

```sh
gitmoot lock list --repo owner/repo
gitmoot lock show owner/repo <branch>
```

## Files And Secrets

Do not commit generated data, caches, logs, build outputs, session archives,
cloned helper repos, secrets, credentials, or large artifacts unless the user or
plan explicitly says they are intended tracked fixtures or release assets.

Redact secrets from GitHub comments, job summaries, raw examples, and copied
command output.

## External Contracts

If the work depends on external APIs, CLIs, env vars, generated scripts, service
launchers, installers, deployment behavior, or third-party libraries, verify the
real contract with local commands and/or official documentation before editing.

## When To Stop

Stop and report `blocked` when the target repo is unclear, GitHub auth is
missing, the daemon cannot access the repo, branch lock ownership is wrong, or
continuing would require credentials or destructive operations the user did not
approve.
